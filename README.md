# User-Story-Management-Tool
In a project, we need user stories to capture description of a software from an end-user perspective that which fosters collaboration and brings users closer. So a project can have any number of user stories and it might have sub user-stories too. So it is a tool that manages all user stories. 

For the development, it is build on NodeJS environment and ReactJS on the client side.

```
